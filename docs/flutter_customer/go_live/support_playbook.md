## Customer Issues

### "I scanned the QR but it opened a website, not the app."
**Explanation**: This is normal behavior if the app is not installed or if deep links are disabled on the phone.
**Solution**:
1.  Use the website (it works just as well!).
2.  OR: Install the app from the footer link on the website, then scan again.

### "It says 'Too many requests' when I order."
**Explanation**: Security protection against spam.
**Solution**:
1.  Wait 1 minute.
2.  Try again.
3.  Are you sharing Wifi? Disconnect and try 4G.

### "I clicked Pay with MoMo/Revolut but nothing happened."
**Explanation**: The app tries to open the payment app/dialer.
**Solution**:
1.  **MoMo**: Do you have a signal? Manually dial `*182*...` if needed (Venue can provide code).
2.  **Revolut**: Do you have the Revolut app installed?
3.  **Workaround**: Select "Cash" and pay the waiter manually via transfer/card terminal.

## Venue Issues

### "I'm not getting Bell notifications."
**Explanation**: Notifications might be blocked or volume off.
**Troubleshooting**:
1.  Is the Venue Admin Portal open?
2.  Is the device online?
3.  Check volume settings.
4.  Engage Engineering if persistent (Severity 2).

### "An order came in but has no items."
**Explanation**: Data sync error (verify severity).
**Action**:
1.  Refresh the Admin Portal.
2.  If still empty: **Escalate to Engineering** (Severity 1 - Data Loss).
