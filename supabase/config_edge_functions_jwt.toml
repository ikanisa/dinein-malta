# Phase 1: Edge Function JWT Verification Configuration
# This file documents which Edge Functions should have JWT verification enabled
# Update config.toml to enable verify_jwt = true for sensitive functions

# Functions that REQUIRE authentication (verify_jwt = true):
# - order_create (creates orders - requires authenticated client)
# - order_update_status (updates order status - requires vendor/admin)
# - order_mark_paid (marks orders as paid - requires vendor/admin)
# - vendor_claim (claims vendor - requires authenticated user)
# - tables_generate (generates QR codes - requires vendor/admin)
# - apply_migrations (admin only - requires admin auth)

# Functions that can be PUBLIC (verify_jwt = false):
# - gemini-features (public API for discovery/search, but has internal auth checks)
# - nearby_places_live (currently has verify_jwt = true, can be public with rate limiting)

# To enable JWT verification, update config.toml:
# [functions.order_create]
# verify_jwt = true
#
# [functions.order_update_status]
# verify_jwt = true
#
# etc.
